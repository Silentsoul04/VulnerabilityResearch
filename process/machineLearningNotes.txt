17 dimension data set? one for each column

boundary line/plane: w1x1 + w2x2 ...+ wnxn + b = 0 
ynot: prediction is 1 if >=0, else prediction is 0
weight (w1, w2, ... wn, b )

Perceptron
returns 1/0 based on weight >/< 0
bias labels a node, and w1 and w2 label edges going to the node. Can also put bias on an edge
