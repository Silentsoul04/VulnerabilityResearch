Gathering Data Set
1. Queried for files that were documented with CWE-89 (SQL Injection)
Used various PHP projects, like typo3
2. Obtained files from GitHub by analyzing diff files for changes.
Also downloaded open source projects from sourceforge.
Used links associated with CVEs to find vulnerability descriptions
3. Used PHP Test Suite for vulnerable and nonvulnerable files
Used Astrogrep to get files associated with CWE-89. (File Type query is *89*.*)
Safe samples labeled as nonvulnerable.
Unsafe samples labeled as vulnerable.
Used script to divide files into vulner and nonvulner based on if they contained safe/unsafe keywords

Look for use of input validation and input sanitization

Potential Challenges and Limitations of a Classifier
* May not be able to detect which variables should be integers (quantity, id)
* Programs may use their own functions for SQL query sanitization. Must be able to recognize those
* Some programs use string concatenation to build SQL queries, which is unsafe.
  However, they also sanitize inputs, which adds safety.
* Input may be passed into one file, but the actual query may be in a different file, especially with function calls

Determining Features
Binary classification: expected outputs were nonvulnerable (0) or vulnerable (1)
Supervised learning: expected output is known beforehand. Learned from CVE reports and safe/unsafe keywords in test suite
Used the 18 self-obtained features
Used a bag of words approach, w/ a tdidf vectorizer. Implemented stop words, like variable names. Maybe self-defined functions as well
Used a word2vec embedding to turn relations between words into features.

Building Classifiers
Used libraries like Sci-Kit Learn
Divided into 70% training and 30% testing
Performed 10-fold cross validation
Tested the following algorithms:
* Gaussian Naive Bayes
* Random Forest
* Logistic Regression
* Multilayer Perceptron
* Long Short-Term Memory
* May eventually have Convolutional Neural Network
Analyzed results based on accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score. Involves true positives, false positives, etc.
