Gathering Data Set
1. Queried for files that were documented with CWE-89 (SQL Injection)
Used various PHP projects, like typo3
2. Obtained files from GitHub by analyzing diff files for changes


Look for use of input validation and input sanitization

Potential Challenges and Limitations of a Classifier
* May not be able to detect which variables should be integers (quantity, id)
* Programs may use their own functions for SQL query sanitization. Must be able to recognize those
* Some programs use string concatenation to build SQL queries, which is unsafe.
  However, they also sanitize inputs, which adds safety.
* Input may be passed into one file, but the actual query may be in a different file, especially with function calls
